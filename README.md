# Weather-Web-Server

# Local Server
To run in a local server use : nodemon src/app.js -e js.hbs

Or

As i have added the nodemon as devdependey so you can simply use: npm start dev

It is becasuse previously we have nodemon as global but then we installed it as: npm i nodemon --save-dev

It means it will run only during the development enviroment. Cool.....


# Heroku server
For the heroku use : https://aniq-weather-application.herokuapp.com/weather
